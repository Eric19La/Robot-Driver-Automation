# Internship Sample Project Submission

## 📋 Project Summary

This submission fulfills **all three sections** of the internship sample project requirements:

1. ✅ **Required Core** - Robot Driver (Foundational Skills)
2. ✅ **Optional Challenge 1** - AI Brain with MCP (Advanced Skills)
3. ✅ **Optional Challenge 2** - Making It Shareable (Deployment Skills)

## 🎯 Requirements Fulfillment

### 1. Required Core: The Robot Driver ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implementation:** `robot_driver.py`

**Features:**
- ✅ Python program using Playwright for browser automation
- ✅ Completes a fixed, single task (searches for "wireless mouse" on Amazon and reports price)
- ✅ Performs all necessary browser actions:
  - Navigate to URL (Amazon)
  - Click elements (search submission)
  - Type text (product search query)
- ✅ Robust error handling:
  - Handles TimeoutError for slow pages
  - Handles missing elements gracefully
  - Never crashes, always provides feedback
- ✅ Clear console output with success/failure messages

**Key Code Highlights:**
- Async/await pattern for modern Python
- Multiple CSS selectors as fallbacks
- Try-catch blocks with specific error types
- User-friendly console output
- Clean code structure with docstrings

### 2. Optional Challenge 1: AI Brain with MCP ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implementation:** `ai_robot_driver.py`

**Features:**
- ✅ Execution steps determined dynamically by AI (Claude LLM)
- ✅ Accepts plain English goals from user
- ✅ Integration with Playwright for page context extraction
- ✅ Provides structured page information to AI:
  - Current URL and title
  - Interactive elements with roles, IDs, names, labels
  - Accessibility data for intelligent decision-making
- ✅ AI generates step-by-step plans in structured JSON format
- ✅ Executes actions: navigate, click, type, wait, done
- ✅ Adaptive behavior based on page state

**AI Architecture:**
- Uses Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model
- Structured prompt engineering for reliable JSON responses
- Page context extraction using accessibility attributes
- Action loop with reasoning at each step
- Graceful handling of AI response parsing

**Example Goal:** "Go to Amazon and find the price of a wireless mouse"

### 3. Optional Challenge 2: Making It Shareable ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implementation:** `api.py`

**Features:**
- ✅ Network-accessible API using FastAPI
- ✅ Web endpoint accepting message parameter:
  - `POST /execute` - Execute automation tasks
  - `GET /health` - Service health check
  - `GET /` - API information
- ✅ Clear setup instructions in README.md
- ✅ requirements.txt with all dependencies
- ✅ Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI at /docs)
- ✅ Proper error handling and HTTP status codes
- ✅ Supports both "basic" and "ai" execution modes

**API Design:**
- RESTful design principles
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Environment-based configuration
- JSON responses with success/error states
- OpenAPI/Swagger auto-documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation (< 5 minutes)

```bash
# Clone and enter directory
cd Robot-Driver-Automation

# Run automated setup
./setup.sh

# Or manual setup:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

# For AI mode, configure API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

### Running the Project

**1. Test Basic Mode (Required Core):**
```bash
python robot_driver.py
# or
python test_basic.py
```

**2. Test AI Mode (Optional Challenge 1):**
```bash
# Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env
python ai_robot_driver.py
```

**3. Test API Mode (Optional Challenge 2):**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
python api.py

# Terminal 2: Test endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/execute" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "test", "mode": "basic"}'

# Or visit http://localhost:8000/docs for interactive testing
```

Test the basic functionality:
```bash
python test_basic.py
```

## 💡 Design Decisions
